Lease Management Software

# NetWork
The lease network was created using **Hyperledger Composer**.
It is however now deprecated and the time of uploading the project, I did not insert the used source code.
This means the front-end builds but lacks its blockchain backend

# Future
With the increase in popularity of Ethereum, I would need to find time to make Smart Contracts to enforce Lease agreements between the Property Owners and Tenants.
